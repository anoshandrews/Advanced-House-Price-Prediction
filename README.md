Advanced House Price Prediction
Overview
This project aims to predict house prices based on various features using advanced regression techniques. The dataset used is the House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques from Kaggle, which contains various attributes related to the houses, including their sale prices.

Objectives
Explore and analyze the dataset to understand the underlying patterns.
Clean the data and handle missing values.
Apply feature engineering to enhance model performance.
Train multiple regression models and compare their performance.
Evaluate the model using appropriate metrics.
Dataset

The dataset contains two files: ----Of them only one has been pushed so far

train.csv: The training data with features and corresponding sale prices.
test.csv: The test data for predictions.(Yet to be added)
Key Features
Id: Unique identifier for each house.
LotFrontage: Linear feet of street connected to the property.
OverallQual: Rates the overall material and finish of the house (1-10 scale).
SalePrice: The target variable (price of the house).

Installation
Clone the repository:(bash)
git clone https://github.com/your_username/house-price-prediction.git

Navigate into the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd house-price-prediction
Install the required packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
To run the project, you can execute the following code in your Python environment:

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
train_data = pd.read_csv('train.csv')
test_data = pd.read_csv('test.csv')

# Add your data preprocessing and model training code here
Results
The performance of different models will be evaluated based on:

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
RÂ² Score
The best model will be selected based on these metrics.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the process of building a predictive model for house prices using advanced regression techniques. It covers data exploration, preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation.
